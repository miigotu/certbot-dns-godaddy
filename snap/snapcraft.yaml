      # Constraints are passed through the environment variable PIP_CONSTRAINTS instead of using the
      # parts.[part_name].constraints option available in snapcraft.yaml when the Python plugin is
      # used. This is done to let these constraints be applied not only on the certbot package
      # build, but also on any isolated build that pip could trigger when building wheels for
      # dependencies. See https://github.com/certbot/certbot/pull/8443 for more info.
